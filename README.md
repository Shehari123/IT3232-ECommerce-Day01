## How to Compile and Run

1. Compile individual programs:
   ```
   javac one.java
   javac Student.java StudentMain.java
   javac LibraryDemo.java
   javac Main.java
   ```

2. Run the compiled programs:
   ```
   java one
   java StudentMain
   java LibraryDemo
   java Main
   ```

## Notes
- The programs demonstrate progressively more complex Java concepts
- Each program can be run independently
- Some programs may require input from the user
